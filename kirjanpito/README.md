# Pajat App

The application is available on [Expo](https://expo.io/@grp-toska/kirjanpito). You can load it on your Android device with the QR-code. Users with an iOS device need [an invitation link](https://blog.expo.io/upcoming-limitations-to-ios-expo-client-8076d01aee1a) and they need to be signed in to their Expo Client with same Expo credentials by which app is published.

The app is developed with [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/). You can install it globally with npm.

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

You can read more advanced documentation about the app (in Finnish) [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fGJ22iuBzEF0rlHc6F-doSJdJR5klNU_cb_Ok3nNyQo/edit?usp=sharing).
