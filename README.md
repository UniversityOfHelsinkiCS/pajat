## Embedded calendars

There's an embedded view for multiple and single courses. Both views will automatically refresh themselves with a sensible interval.

Multiple courses view is at https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/pajat2/public/screen. You can choose the displayed courses by providing a `courseCodes` query parameter with the course codes separated by a comma. For example https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/pajat2/public/screen?courseCodes=tkt20002,tkt20006.

The single course view is at path `/pajat2/public/screen/:courseCode` where `:courseCode` is the course's course code. For example https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/pajat2/public/screen/tkt20002. If you want to display the course's name you can set the `showCourseName` query parameter as `true`. For example https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/pajat2/public/screen/tkt20002?showCourseName=true.

Both views accept a `dense` query parameter which, if set to `false` will add small padding for the view. For example https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/pajat2/public/screen?courseCodes=tkt20002&dense=false.

A calendar can be embedded into a website using a [<iframe>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) tag. For example:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/pajat2/public/screen/tkt20002"
  style="border: 0px; width: 100%; height: 600px;"
></iframe>
```

## Environment configuration

Create a `.env` file inside the project's root directory. In that file, copy the contents of the `.env.template` file and add correct values for the variables based on the documentation.

## Database migrations

Database migrations are ran automatically once the server starts. If you want to create a new migration, run `npm run migrate:make <name>`.

## Module missing?

Install the dependencies **inside** the container to have the application **inside** the container access them. You can use `npm run bash` to get inside the container to do so.
